### ðŸ“• Books
- "Das Kapital"

> Marx believed that capital can develop only if it constantly squeezes labor. In Marx's analysis, in order to maximize profits, capitalists will deliberately lower the wages of laborers, keeping wages at a low level that can only sustain the survival of laborers (and their families) and enable population growth. The newly-increased working population provides a steady stream of exploitation targets for the reproduction of capital. Due to fierce competition among capitalists, small and medium-sized enterprises with weaker competitiveness gradually lose their position and are annexed or destroyed by powerful enterprises. This caused the petty bourgeoisie to gradually degenerate into the proletariat. The proportion of the bourgeoisie in the population gradually declined, while the proportion of the proletariat rose correspondingly. This led to the eventual fragmentation of society into two classes with directly opposed interests.

-  "Tao Te Ching"
> The best way to do good is like water, which moistens everything but never fights with it. He is willing to be in the lowly place that people hate, so it is close to the Tao. To live, we should be as humble as water. We should be as deep-seated as water. We should treat people as water. We should be as intimate as water. We should talk as water. We should be as honest as water. We should be good at governance. We should be as omnipotent as water. We should act as water and seize the opportunity. It is precisely because he does not contend with things that he has no fault.
